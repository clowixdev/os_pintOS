# Laboratory course on "Operating Systems". 2 course, 1 semester, IC of SPBSTU

There will be listed some labs that I need to complete during OS course.

## About

All the labs and reports that will be completed during this course will be located in the related branches. In this branches you can check pintOS source code in the exact state of completing OS course during semester.

## Installing PintOS (using **Ubuntu 16.04 x64**)

*You can check step-by-step giude in Russian [here](./pintos_install.pdf).*

**1. Gathering all needed packages with command:**

```console
user@host:~$ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib make perl qemu
```

&emsp;&emsp;you can use:

- `qemu-system` instead of `qemu` if qemu is not found.
- `gcc-5.4` instead of `gcc-multilib` if any problem appears with it.
- `gcc` instead of `gcc-multilib` if you have `x86` system.

**2. Creating a link to ease emulation process:**

```console
user@host:~$ ln /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 /usr/bin/qemu
```

&emsp;&emsp;If you have any problems with this step, check the location where `qemu-system` is installed and edit command using your installation location. P.S. for `x86` use `qemu-system-x86`

**3. Unpacking PintOS source files:**

```console
user@host:~$ tar â€“zxf pintos.tar.gz
```

&emsp;&emsp;Extract all the source files where it will be handy for you to edit them

**4. Preparing scripts to compile and run PintOS:**

```console
user@host:~$ cd pintos/src/utils
user@host:~/pintos/src/utils$ sudo cp -f backtrace pintos pintos-mkdisk pintos-set-cmdline Pintos.pm pintos-gdb ../misc/gdb-macros /usr/bin/
user@host:~/pintos/src/utils$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/backtrace /usr/bin/pintos /usr/bin/pintos-mkdisk /usr/bin/pintos-setcmdline /usr/bin/pintos-gdb
user@host:~/pintos/src/utils$ sudo chmod 644 /usr/bin/Pintos.pm /usr/bin/gdb-macros
```

&emsp;&emsp;By doing this, you moving all the files to system `/usr/bin` folder and granting them rights to be read and executed

**x. Fixing known issues:**

When you've done all the steps above, you can meet one known bug that is caused by encoding:

```console
Unrecognized character \x16; marked by <-- HERE after   if ($<-- HERE near column 7 at /usr/bin/pintos line 911.
```

In order to fix it, you need to re-type `$^V` sequence in `/usr/bin/pintos` file exactly in `911` string `if ($^V ge 5.8.0) { ... }`. After doing this everything should work fine.

### Congrats! On this step, everything is ready to work with PintOS

## Launching tests in PintOS

*You can check step-by-step giude in Russian [here](./pintos_testing.pdf).*

To launch any test in PintOS, you need to compile its kernel by using `make` command. Enter `pintos_directory/src/threads` and compile kernel here by using:

```console
user@host:~$ cd pintos/src/threads
user@host:~$ /pintos/src/threads$ make
```

Then, you can launch any tests and get results with this syntax, where you change **\<LABDIR>** and **\<TESTID>** to what you need:

```console
user@host:~$ cd pintos_location/src/threads/build
user@host:~/pintos_location/src/threads/build$ rm tests/<LABDIR>/*.result && (make tests/<LABDIR>/<TESTDIR>.result && make ... ) | grep -E "pass | fail"
```

After executing this command, you will see all the test results without any extra output:

```console
...
pass /tests/<LABDIR>/<TESTDIR>.o
fail /tests/<LABDIR>/<TESTDIR>.o
...
```

### Have fun exploring how operating systems works using this small OS
